For this assignment, I chose to focus on Single Table Inheritance and setting up different routes for each user type. My schema and associations took me a while to implement the way I wanted but I was happy for the chance to play with it. My visual design might not be much to look at (it is an Admin panel after all!) but I think my back-end design is robust and past requirements. I chose to put my focus here, because it is the area I'm more passionate about. I also chose to implement full CRUD functionality with AJAX for assignments and announcements (when logged in as a teacher).  

I did go a bit crazy with the routes. Because every user has their own it took me a long time to simple set up the bones of the project. Perhaps I could have planned better, and then I would have had good design on BOTH ends. Live and learn. I'm hoping to come back to this project after the Fellowship and fixing it up. I'd like to add a calendar.
